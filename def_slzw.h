//  Revision History:
//		25 Oct 2006		Chris Sadler		Initial Release
//		10 Mar 2007		Chris Sadler		Increased WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE to properly handle the
//											case where the data is very random and compression
//											actually causes it to expand.

// This page size is based on a 4 Mbit Atmel Flash.
#define FLASH_PAGE_SIZE				264

// Two flash pages.  This is the maximum amount of data that you can compress.  If you increase it,
// it will cost you more RAM.
#define BLOCK_SIZE					(FLASH_PAGE_SIZE << 1)
									
// You can increase the number of dictionary entries to 4096, but there are only 12 bits allocated
// in each dictionary entry so it won't work for more than that.

// Uncomment this line if you want the dictionary to reset when it fills.
//#define RESETABLE_DICTIONARY

// These definitions are for the mini-cache.
#define USE_MINICACHE

// If this #define is uncommented, it will add entries to the mini-cache as they are created.
// We recommend that you enable this option.

// Technically, if the data is completely random, LZW can increase the size of the data.  If you
// have 10 bit entries (9 bit dictionary plus a 1 bit escape character for the mini-cache), the
// maximum size is (10/8)*size of the buffer.  We use a larger buffer to make sure we don't
// accidentally over run.
